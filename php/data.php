//About data
$bioText = "Nourine Hammad, born in 1989, stood out as early as her childhood years with her talent for drawing. Through her family's continuous support and motivation, she believes they played the most significant role in developing her talent to professionalism. At 2012, she acquired her Bachelor's degree of Engineering in Cairo. Reinforced by the laws of mathematics and the facts of physics, Nourine looked forward to delivering her talent up to a higher level producing a projection of real objects on paper. With her own independent study and practice, she learned the techniques to create hyperrealistic three dimensional art. \n \n The thriving success of Nourine to continuously snatch the gazes of awe out of people mistaking her paintings for real objects encouraged her to shift her career and devote herself thoroughly to her artwork.  She quitted her job, thus, at IBM, where she had been working as a software engineer for 3 years and turned with an intense focus and ambition to show her artwork and exhibit it in London. At 2015 until present, Nourine has taken part in several exhibitions in Plus One Gallery in London. \n \n \"Working in pastels, pencils and charcoal Nourine Hammad not only strives to produce works that are representational, but goes beyond that and tries to discover the truth within her subjects. By approaching her subject matter honestly and without vanity, she strives to create detailed work that celebrates perfection and imperfection which coexist comfortably alongside each other. The way Hammad plays with objects and colour is sophisticated and balanced. A feast for the eyes.\" - Plus One Gallery";
